### Online Store Project

👨‍💻 **What was developed**

In this project, we created a simplified version, without database persistence, of an online store, developing its functionalities in a group according to defined demands on a Kanban board, in a scenario close to that of the job market.

Based on these demands, an application will be developed where users will be able to:

- Search for products by terms and categories through the Mercado Livre API.
- Interact with the searched products, adding and removing them from a shopping cart in different quantities.
- View details and previous reviews of a product, as well as create new reviews.
- Simulate the checkout process for the selected items.

📝 **Skills**

In this project, we will:

- Understand what Agile Methods are.
- Understand what Kanban is.
- Understand what Scrum is.
- Work in teams using Kanban or Scrum effectively.
- Practice all skills developed so far in the Front-end module.

⚛️ **Technologies and Tools**

- React.js
- Mercado Livre API
- Kanban or Scrum
